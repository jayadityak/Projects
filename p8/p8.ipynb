    "## Project Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "You **may not** hardcode indices in your code, unless the question explicitly asks you to do so. If you open your `.csv` files with Excel, manually count through the rows and use this number to loop through the dataset, this is also considered as hardcoding. If any instances of hardcoding are found during code review, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Functions:\n",
    "- `get_mapping`\n",
    "- `get_raw_movies`\n",
    "- `get_movies`\n",
    "- `find_specific_movies`\n",
    "- `bucketize_by_genre`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Data Structures:\n",
    "- `small_movies`\n",
    "- `movies`\n",
    "- `genre_dict`\n",
    "\n",
    "You are only allowed to define these data structures **once** and the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score if you redefine the values of these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project (and the next), you will be asked to create **lists** of movies. For all such questions, **unless it is explicitly mentioned otherwise**, the movies should be in the **same order** as in the `movies.csv` (or `small_movies.csv`) file. Similarly, for each movie, the **list** of `genres`, `directors`, and `cast` members should always be in the **same order** as in the `movies.csv` (or `small_movies.csv`) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students are only allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of P8. Therefore, you should not use the pandas module.  the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:\n",
    "- **Do not use the method `csv.DictReader` for P8**. Although the required output can be obtained using this method, one of the learning outcomes of this project is to demonstrate your ability to build dictionaries with your own code.  \n",
    "- Additional import statements beyond those that are stated in the directions are not allowed. For this project, we allow you to use `csv` and `copy` packages (that is, you can use the `import csv` and `import copy` statements in your submission). You should not use concepts / modules that are yet to be covered in this course; for example: you should not use modules like `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points accordingly, if you don't follow the provided directions.\n",

    "For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s23-projects/-/blob/main/p8/rubric.md)."

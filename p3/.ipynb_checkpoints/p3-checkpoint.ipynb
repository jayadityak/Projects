Start by executing all the cells (including the ones containing `import` statements).\n",

For example, if we ask how many Nissan Leaf cars were sold in 2019, you **must** obtain the answer with this code: `get_sales(get_id(\"Nissan Leaf\"), 2019)`.

    "For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer.  If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",

    "## Incremental Coding and Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should always strive to do incremental coding. Incremental coding enables you to avoid challenging bugs. Always write a few lines of code and then test those lines of code, before proceeding to write further code. You can call the `print` function to test intermediate step outputs. **Store your final answer for each question in the variable recommended for each question.** This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer. So, if you store your answer in a different variable, you will not get points for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recommend you do incremental testing: make sure to run the local tests as soon as you are done with a question. This will ensure that you haven't made a big mistake that might potentially impact the rest of your project solution. Please refrain from making multiple submissions on Gradescope for testing individual questions' answers. Instead use the local tests, to test your solution on your laptop. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, it is very **important** that you check the *Gradescope* test results as soon as you submit your project on Gradescope. Test results on *Gradescope* are typically available somewhere between 2 to 10 minutes after the submission."

# # Project 6: Airbnb

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project, you will demonstrate how to:
#
# * access and utilize data in CSV files,
# * process real world datasets,
# * use string methods and sorting function / method to order data.
#
# Please go through [Lab-P6](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p6) before working on this project. The lab introduces some useful techniques related to this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the file `p6_test.py`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the value of the variable `expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.

# ## Project Description:
#
# Data Science can help us understand user behavior on online platform services. This project is about the rooms listed on Airbnb. Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. `airbnb.csv` has data of nearly 50,000 listings on Airbnb from New York City, NY from the year 2019. This file includes a lot of information about the hosts, geographical availability of the listings, and other necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions. You will be using various string manipulation methods that come with Python as well as creating some of your own functions to solve the problems posed. Happy coding!

# #### Now, copy and paste the `process_csv` and `cell` functions from your Lab-P6 notebook to the cell below.
#
# You are expected to call the `process_csv` function correctly, and read the data on `airbnb.csv`. After reading the file, define the `csv_header`, and `csv_rows` variables as in Lab-P6, and define the `cell` function.
#
# **Important:** You **must** only use the `cell` function to extract data from the dataset. If you extract any data without explicitly using this function, you will **lose points** during manual review. It is recommended but **optional** that you use the `cell_v2` function defined in Lab-P6. However, you **must** rename the function to `cell` in this notebook.

# ### Function 6: `find_good_rooms(room_type, neighborhood, number_of_reviews_threshold)`
#
# We require you to complete the below function to answer the next several questions (this is a **requirement**, and you will **lose points** if you do not implement this function).  
#
# Price, location, room type and number of reviews are metrics that people look into when they book a room in Airbnb. 
# In this function, we want to return a **list** of all the room names (`name`) of the given `room_type` from the given `neighborhood` who have received **at least** `number_of_reviews_threshold` many reviews (`number_of_reviews`), and are **cheaper** than the **average** priced (`price`) room of the given `room_type` from that `neighborhood`.
#
# The order of the **list** does **not** matter. You **must** **ignore** any rooms for which the `price`, `room_type`, `neighborhood`, or `number_of_reviews` data is **missing**. If the average `price` of rooms of the given `room_type` from the given `neighborhood` **cannot be computed** due to missing data, then the function **must** return `None`.
#
# **For example**, let's consider the following small dataset:  
#
# `name`| `price` |`number_of_reviews`|`room_type`|`neighborhood`
# ------|------|------|------|------|
# room_one| 65 | 165| Private room |Jamaica
# room_two| 50 |200| Private room |Jamaica
# room_three| 80| 120| Private room |Jamaica
# room_four| 300| 300| Private room |Jamaica
# room_five| 450| 240| Private room |Jamaica
# room_six| 180| 150| Private room |Jamaica
#
# In this small dataset, we want to find the list of all room names in *Jamaica* of `room_type` *Private room* with **at least** *150* reviews that have a price **lower** than the **average** price of `room_type` *Private room* in *Jamaica*. 
#     
# 1. The **average** `price` of a *Private room* in the `neighborhood` *Jamaica* is:
# $$\frac{65 + 50 + 80 + 300 + 450 + 180}{6} = 187.5.$$  
#
# 2. We can see that there are *4* rooms (`room_one`, `room_two`, `room_three`, and `room_six`) with a `price` **lower** than the **average**, *187.5*. Of these rooms, *3* of them (`room_one`, `room_two`, and `room_six`) also have `number_of_reviews` **at least** *150*.
#
# 3. So, the output should be the **list** `["room_one", "room_two", "room_six"]`.
#
# The `find_good_rooms` function definition **must** invoke the function `avg_price_per_room_type`. **We'll manually deduct points** if you don't use `avg_price_per_room_type`.

# **Question 20:** On a trip to NYC, you need to stay for *3* days in *Queens*, and then *4* days in *Brooklyn*. What is the **minimum** amount of money you need to spend on this trip?
#
# Note that:
# 1. The `price` of each room is for one day, and you'll only stay in one room at each location.
# 2. The total cost = (lowest price in *Queens*) * 3 + (lowest price in *Brooklyn*) * 4.
# 3. You'll need to **skip** those rooms that don't have enough availability, for example, you **must** ignore rooms in *Queens* whose availability is **less than** *3*.
# 4. You'll need to **skip** those rooms for which you don't meet the required number of `minimum_nights`, for example, you **must** ignore rooms in *Brooklyn* whose `minimum_nights` is **greater than** *4*.
# 5. You **must** skip all rooms with any of the relevant data missing.
#
#
# **Hint:** You might want to define a helper function to compute the **minimum** daily `price` of a room in a given `neighborhood_group` among rooms whose `availability_365` is at least the number of days one will be staying in that neighborhood group, and the `minimum_nights` is at most the number of the number of days one will be staying in that neighborhood group.

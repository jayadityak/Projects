    "\n",
    "Universal access to safe drinking water is a fundamental need and human right. Securing access for all would go a long way in reducing illness and death, especially among children. \"Safely managed\" drinking water services represent an ambitious new rung on the ladder used to track progress on drinking water. Since 2000, 2 billion people have gained access to safely managed services (i.e., accessible on-premises, available when needed, and free from contamination). In 2020, 5.8 billion people used safely managed services and a further 2 billion people used basic services. However, 771 million people still lacked even a basic level of service, including 282 million who used a “limited” water service (source from which water collection time exceeds 30 minutes), 367 million who used unimproved sources and 122 million who still collected drinking water directly from rivers, lakes, and other surface water sources. The data reveal pronounced disparities, with the poorest and those living in rural areas least likely to use a basic service. In most countries, the burden of water collection continues to fall mainly to women and girls.\n",
    "\n",
    "[The Unicef website](https://data.unicef.org/) states that \"consistent, credible data about children’s situations are critical to the improvement of their lives – and indispensable to realizing the rights of every child.\" Data Scientists will play an important role in reaching this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you'll be analyzing data drawn from multiple sources. Our data is primarily drawn from the report titled [\"Progress on Household Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene\"](https://washdata.org/sites/default/files/2021-07/jmp-2021-wash-households.pdf) data published by the Unicef/WHO Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (2021). The original dataset can be found [here](https://data.unicef.org/topic/water-and-sanitation/drinking-water/) if you are interested in exploring the dataset yourself. Our dataset is further augmented by data from The World Bank on the [income levels of each country](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html)."

For this project, we will focus on the **percentage of population** of each country who had **at least basic** water supply in the years **2015** and **2020**. Open `water_accessibility.csv` with Microsoft Excel or some other Spreadsheet viewer and look at the list of countries in the dataset. Data for each country appears twice, one row for the year *2015* and the other row for year *2020*. Countries which had incomplete data have been **omitted** from the dataset, and we will **ignore** those countries in this project.

    "\n",
    "You **may not** hardcode indices in your code, unless the question explicitly says so. If you open your `.csv` file with Excel, manually count through the rows and use this number to loop through the dataset, this is also considered as hardcoding. We'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope during code review. You are **allowed** to assume that the dataset is ordered in such a way that the *even indices* (0, 2 .. etc;) corresponds to the rows with information for the year 2015, and the *odd indices* (1, 3 .. etc;) correspond to the rows with information for year 2020. Using this fact about the dataset will **not** be considered hardcoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Required Functions:\n",
    "- `cell`\n",
    "- `get_col_dict`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Data Structures:\n",
    "- `dict_2015`\n",
    "- `dict_2020`\n",
    "- `rural_non_alb_bin_2015_dict`\n",
    "- `rural_non_alb_bin_2020_dict`\n",
    "    \n",
    "Students are only allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of p7. Therefore, **you should not use the pandas module**.  We will **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s23-projects/-/blob/main/p7/rubric.md)."

    "\n",
    "You should always strive to do incremental coding. **Incremental coding enables you to avoid challenging bugs.** Always write a few lines of code and then test those lines of code, before proceeding to write further code. You can call the `print` function to test intermediate step outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also recommend you do incremental testing: make sure to run the local tests as soon as you are done with a question. This will ensure that you haven't made a big mistake that might potentially impact the rest of your project solution. Please refrain from making multiple submissions on Gradescope for testing individual questions' answers. Instead use the local tests, to test your solution on your laptop.\n",
